APP that helps close the food desert


Mission Statement:

It's painful to witness food being wasted, particularly in America. It's even more disheartening to see people in the country facing limited or no access to healthy food options. One of the significant problems in America is the existence of food deserts. To address this issue, "Jukwiwi" aims to bridge the food gap by connecting you with nearby local farmers (in urban, rural, and suburban areas) who offer quality food at affordable rates and contribute to the local community. 

About Us

I've been working on a personal project with my friend Briana called Jukwiw for some time now. Our goal is to create a non-profit app that addresses food deserts. It's crucial to help people gain access to clean, locally grown food that is nearby and affordable. Brianna and I have been working together to combat food deserts by teaching people how to grow their own food and find locally sourced produce in urban areas. The app will be launched by the end of the year, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it and make a positive impact in the world. Our aim is to provide hope and support to people by offering affordable and nutritious food options. 

Our goal is to empower individuals with the knowledge and skills to cultivate their own food. We were motivated by the increasing cost of food and the wastage of unsold produce. Our aim is to promote awareness about the source of one's food and encourage people to take charge of their own nourishment. After all, as the saying goes, "Food is thy medicine." It is our aspiration to ensure that everyone has access to their own medicine.
